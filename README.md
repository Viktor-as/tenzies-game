# Tenzies game

![Tenzies game](http://food.internetiniusvetainiukurimas.lt/github_readme_photo/portfolio8.jpg "Tenzies game")

<p>Made with React. </p>
<p>The project is designed to apply the knowledge gained during React courses. Hooks used in the project: useState and useEffect. useState was used to hold variable information that needs to refresh on the page. useEffect was used to track when the win condition is met.</p>
<p>In the project I also used knowledge about components, transferring properties to child components, writing conditional code "Ternary conditions".</p>
<p>The game keeps track of the best score and saves it to the visitor's browser's Local storage cache.</p>
